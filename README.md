# StarsBegone

Toggle display of *"Member"* posts on [medium.com][1].

Ever see a Medium article with a ~~clickbait~~ gripping headline? But then you
see that pesky little â˜… next to the title. Gosh darnit! It's a *Members*-only
post.

Well, now you can save yourself that moment of disappointment - and time - by
avoiding member posts altogether! Have a smoother free-loading experience of
reading ~~native advertisements~~ insightful articles on Medium.

On the click of a button, member posts are hidden. And nothing of value
is lost.

## About

This is my first ever browser extension. I consulted the [WebExtensions Docs][2]
for development.
